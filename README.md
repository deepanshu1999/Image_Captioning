# Image Captioning
## Image Captioning Model
Deep Learning model for generating captions for a given image.
- Trained on 30K Images from [Flickr](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-imag(-datas)t)
- Build over pre-trained InceptionV3 model and GloVe
- Used Word Embedding with Convolutional Neural Net and Recurrent Neural Net to generate results.
- Greedy Searching for searching next best suited word.
